## Building and running

To run Angora locally, clone/download the repo and open the solution (`angora.sln`) in Visual Studio 2013. Make sure that NuGet is allowed to download missing packages (Tools > Options > Package Manager >>> Check both check boxes). Make sure that `Angora.Web` is set as your startup project. You can now build and run the solution.
