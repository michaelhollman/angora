Made with Android Studio ver 0.4.2 (using Gradle 0.9).
Please download Android studio and import the project with that.
Building the project manually with Gradle currently requires you create your own settings.gradle file, not to mention it is untested.

HELP! I'm getting an error!
"Failed to refresh Gradle project 'Angora': The project is using an unsupported version of the Android Gradle plug-in (0.7.3).
Version 0.9.0 introduced incompatible changes in the build language.
Please read the migration guide to learn how to update your project.
Open migration guide, fix plug-in version and re-import project."

Give it a minute. I mean actually let Android Studio sit and think for about 60 seconds. Things will (should) turn green and you will be able to build.
